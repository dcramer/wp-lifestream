Please see the included wpcodex extension for an example of how to create a custom extension and include it.

Extensions should in the following format:

	extensions/<name>/
	extensions/<name>/extension.inc.php -- define your extension class here
	extensions/<name>/icon.png -- 16x16 identifying image

You may include multiple classes in extension.inc.php, but without overriding get_icon_url they will all try to use icon.png.

Your class must still be registered using the following line of code:

	$lifestream->register_feed('ClassName');
